# N.O.V.A-Project
The N.O.V.A. Project is a project about making a handheld robot that has a large neural network.
It will use llama3.2 1B from Meta by use of [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

There will be two different setups for this project:
1. **Server Setup**
    - The server setup method uses a seperate computer that runs everything, while a smaller computer acts as the brain and communicates with the server.
2. **Fully Onboard Setup**
    - The fully onboard setup method contains everything inside of Nova's body.

We will be going over what is happening in each setup's README.md.
