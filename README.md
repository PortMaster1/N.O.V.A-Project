# N.O.V.A-Project
The N.O.V.A. Project is a project about making a handheld robot that has a large neural network.
It will use the TinyLLama 1.1B LLM from Huggingface.


There will be two different setups for this project:
1. *Server Setup*
    - The server setup method uses a seperate computer that runs everything, while a smaller computer acts as the brain and communicates with the server.
2. *Fully Onboard Setup*
    - The fully onboard setup method contains everything inside of Nova's body.

We will be going over what is happening in each setup's README.md.
